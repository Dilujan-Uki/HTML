        <h1>What is a rainbow?</h1>
        <p class="p1">A rain bow is sunlight spread out into its spectrum of colors aand diverted to the eye of the observer by water droplets. The <a>'bow'</a> part of the word refers to the fact that the rainbow is a group of nearly circular arcs of color all having a common center.</p>
        <h1>What makes the bow?</h1>
        <p class="p1"> The main ingredients to see a rainbow are the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You need to be standing with the sun to your back and rain in front of you.</li>
            <li>The sun needs to be less than 42<sup>o</sup>above the horizon.</li>
            <li> The sun's rays must be hitting the rain drops to create the rainbow.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Why did people in Ireland belive there was gold at the end of rainbow?</h1>
        <p class="p2">Even as far back as the 17th centuray,people knew that we cannot see the complete circle of the rainbow. In Ireland,people in the 17th centuray became fond of saying that one was as likely to find a pot of a gold as to find the end of the rainbow. The expression somehow changed, and become a part of mythology.</p>
